## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma among 8 other skin cancer.
- Melanoma is accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## The data set contains the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Using large Neural network are able to predict malanoma cancer.
- In our case due to lack of resources, we don't go further to build deep CNN network, instead we build ``3 layered (include only Conv2D)`` CNN to get accuracy upto ``55%.``
